## Plan
I want to give this project to my friends as a gift. Which means that it needs to be user friendly.
My plan is to have a front-end that will allow them to upload files directly to the pi. Allowing them to configure thier 
display however they want. There will be two modes: Slow-movie mode and Picture mode.
